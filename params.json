{"name":"Pure-guitar-tuner","tagline":"Simple, elegant, useful - A guitar tuner for iOS","body":"Pure Guitar Tuner\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThe idea was to create a simple yet beautiful (free) guitar tuner for iOS that works amazingly. As a guitar player, I am disappointed by the free guitar tuners on the App Store, so here is the proposed remedy.\r\n\r\nPure Guitar Tuner [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pure-guitar-tuner) for interest.\r\n\r\n### Screenshot\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/tfrank64/Pure-Guitar-Tuner/raw/master/Screenshot_05:11:14.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\" height=\"480\" width=\"320\"/>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nCurrent look as of 05/11/2014\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nFeel free to fork the repo and open a pull request. Using fairly normal convention, make changes in a separte branch then request to pull into `master`.\r\n\r\nI lack the sound detection skills on iOS to get the frequency detection working well, but I'm sure we can make it work together.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nPure Guitar Tuner is licensed under the [MIT license.](https://github.com/tfrank64/Pure-Guitar-Tuner/blob/master/LICENSE.md)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
